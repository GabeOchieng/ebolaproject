Welcome to EbolaOpt's documentation!
====================================

This software package determines how to optimally allocate a given, finite 
number of resources during an Ebola virus outbreak in order to minimize the 
spread of the disease and contain the outbreak. This software package
uses a stochastic compartmental model to simulate the spread of the disease.
Given resource constraints and epidemic information, it fits the model
parameters to the epidemic data and use that model to forecast the effect of 
certain interventions on the trajectory of the disease. By modeling the effects 
of different intervention distributions, the software determines how a fixed 
quantity of resources can be allocated in order to have the greatest positive 
impact on controlling an Ebola epidemic.
