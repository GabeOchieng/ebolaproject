This text file explains how the post processing UI works once the analysis had been completed and the output file is dumped to the directory.

The buttons on the user interface are explain as follows:

Import File: Prints the directory the python file and output file are located in. Note: the two files have to be located in the same directory.
Graph: When this button is clicked, it reads input from the output file and graphs it on the space provided. Plot shown in the Qlabel box shows Ebola data projects.

Import Data CSV: Imports the data into a CSV file.
Import Data ASCII: Imports the data into a ASCII file.
